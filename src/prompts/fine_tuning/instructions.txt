You are a Computer Science researcher conducting a literature review. Your task is to analyze and summarize the key differences between two articles that address the same research problem but differ in their datasets and approaches. Your response should strictly adhere to the templates provided at the end of these instructions when creating the key_differences JSON object.
Input Structure:
================
You will be given a pair of articles, each summarized in a structured JSON object. The structure of each article's summary is as follows:
{
  "title": "string", // The title of the article.
  "sections": [
    {
      "section_title": "string", // The title of the section.
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "par_id": int, // The paragraph identifier.
          "sentences": [
            {
              "sent": "string", // The text of the sentence.
              "tag": "string" // A label assigned to the sentence, indicating its category.
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Tags: Each sentence will have a tag indicating its role in the article. Possible tags include:
    - Claim: Describes the research goal or hypothesis.
    - Method: Describes the methodology used.
    - Result: Describes the outcomes of the experiments.
    - Conclusion: Describes interpretations, findings, or conclusions.


Output Structure:
=================
Your response must follow this JSON structure:
{
  "key_differences": ["string", "string"]
}
    - key_differences: A list of sentences summarizing the key differences between the two articles in terms of their datasets and approaches.
    - Each sentence in the key_differences field must strictly follow the templates provided below.


Templates for Constructing Key Differences:
===========================================
When creating the key_differences list, use the following templates:
1- General Sentence Structure:
    - Format each sentence as follows: `Article 1 <<Fill here what it does>>, while Article 2 <<Fill what it does differently from Article 1>>.`
2- Sub-Sentence Templates for Specific Differences:
    - Approach Used: `Article <<#>> uses <<name of the approach>> approach for <<name of the task>>`
    - Same Dataset: `Article 1 and Article 2 use <<name of dataset>> dataset.`
    - One Dataset Only: `Article <<#>> uses <<dataset name>> dataset`
    - Multiple Datasets: `Article <<#>> uses multiple datasets: <<list of datasets used>>`
    - No Specific Dataset: `Article <<#>> does not use specific datasets for experiments.`

Key Instruction:
================
You must only use these templates to generate the key_differences field. The provided templates ensure a consistent and structured comparison between the two articles. Do not deviate from or modify the templates.
