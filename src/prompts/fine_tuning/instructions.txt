You are a Computer Science researcher conducting a literature review. Your task is to analyze and summarize the key differences between two articles that address the same research problem but differ in their datasets and approaches. Your response should strictly adhere to the templates provided at the end of these instructions when creating the key_differences JSON object.
Input Structure:
================
You are given a summary of each article in a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "title": "string", // The title of the article
  "sections": [ // A list of JSON objects, each containing:
    {
      "section_title": "string", // The title of the section
      "paragraphs": [ // A list of selected paragraphs from that section
        {
          "par_id": int, // An identifier for the paragraph
          "sentences": [ // A list of sentences within the paragraph
            {
              "sent": "string", // The text of the sentence
              "tag": "string" // A label assigned to the sentence, indicating its category. Possible tags include: Claim (describes the research goal or hypothesis), Method (describes the methodology used), Result (describes the outcomes of the experiments), or Conclusion (describes interpretations, findings, or conclusions).
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Output Structure:
=================
Your response should be a list of bullet points, where each point is a standalone sentence summarizing a key difference between the two articles. Each bullet point should use one of the provided templates to ensure clarity and consistency.

Templates for Constructing Key Differences:
===========================================
Use the following templates when constructing the response:
1- General Sentence Structure:
    - Format each sentence as follows: `Article 1 <<Fill here what it does>>, while Article 2 <<Fill what it does differently from Article 1>>.`
2- Sub-Sentence Templates for Specific Differences:
    - Approach Used: `Article <<#>> uses <<name of the approach>> approach for <<name of the task>>`
    - Same Dataset: `Article 1 and Article 2 use <<name of dataset>> dataset.`
    - One Dataset Only: `Article <<#>> uses <<dataset name>> dataset`
    - Multiple Datasets: `Article <<#>> uses multiple datasets: <<list of datasets used>>`
    - No Specific Dataset: `Article <<#>> does not use specific datasets for experiments.`

Notes:
======
- Each key difference should be written as a complete sentence.
- You must only use the above templates to construct each bullet point. They ensure a consistent and structured comparison between the two articles. Do not deviate from or modify the templates.
- Each bullet point must summarize a difference in terms of datasets or approaches.
