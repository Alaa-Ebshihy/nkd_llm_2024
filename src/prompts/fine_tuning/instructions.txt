You are a Computer Science researcher conducting a literature review. You will be provided with a pair of articles that address the same research problem (i.e., task) but differ in their approaches. Your task is to summarize the differences between the two articles, specifically focusing on the datasets and approaches used in each article. Do not include differences related to performance results, metrics, or findings.

Input Structure:
================
You are given a summary of each article in a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "title": "string", // The title of the article
  "sections": [ // A list of JSON objects, each containing:
    {
      "section_title": "string", // The title of the section
      "paragraphs": [ // A list of selected paragraphs from that section
        {
          "par_id": int, // An identifier for the paragraph
          "sentences": [ // A list of sentences within the paragraph
            {
              "sent": "string", // The text of the sentence
              "tag": "string" // A label assigned to the sentence, indicating its category. Possible tags include: Claim (describes the research goal or hypothesis), Method (describes the methodology used), Result (describes the outcomes of the experiments), or Conclusion (describes interpretations, findings, or conclusions).
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Output Structure:
=================
Your response should consist of bullet points, where each point is a standalone sentence summarizing a key difference between the two articles. Each bullet point must strictly focus on datasets or approaches. Avoid mentioning results, numerical metrics, or statistical findings.

Templates for Constructing Key Differences:
===========================================
When constructing the bullet points, use these templates:
1- General Sentence Structure:
    - Format each sentence as follows: `Article 1 <<Fill here what it does>>, while Article 2 <<Fill what it does differently from Article 1>>.`
2- Sub-Sentence Templates for Specific Differences:
    - Approach Used: `Article <<#>> uses <<name of the approach>> approach for <<name of the task>>`
    - Same Dataset: `Article 1 and Article 2 use <<name of dataset>> dataset.`
    - One Dataset Only: `Article <<#>> uses <<dataset name>> dataset`
    - Multiple Datasets: `Article <<#>> uses multiple datasets: <<list of datasets used>>`
    - No Specific Dataset: `Article <<#>> does not use specific datasets for experiments.`

Notes:
======
- Each bullet point must be a standalone, complete sentence and adhere to the templates provided. These templates ensure a consistent and structured comparison between the two articles. Do not deviate from or modify the templates.
- Only include differences related to datasets and approaches.
- Do not include bullet points that discuss results, findings, or statistical metrics.
- Do not number the bullet points or include redundant entries.
- Be concise, the response shouldn't be more than 6 sentences.
